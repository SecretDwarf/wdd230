            <h3>White Space</h3>
            <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/" target="_blank">Serif</a>
            <img src="images/SerifDesigner.png" alt="Serif Affinity Designer">
            <p>Serif does a good job with making white space for their marketing and showcasing of Affinity Designer. Similar to other industry leaders like Apple, Serif provides generous room around text, images, buttons, and banners which helps to provide focus on what is important. It also gives the page a modern look which helps to show their software in a better light.</p>

            <h3>Contrast</h3>
            <a href="https://dopegood.com/" target="_blank">Dopegood</a>
            <img src="images/Doopgood.png" alt="Doopgood">
            <p>Constrast is the primary element used by Dopegood to achieve the viewers attention. Their catalog is built with bright colors which provides an excellent contrast from the black background used throughout design.</p>

        <div class="alignment">
            <!--Alignment allows an observer to read the image more easily and clearly. This is achieved by aligning objects to establish order and avoid haphazardly positioning items in the image.-->
            <h3>Alignment</h3>
            <a href="https://nexus.hexagon.com/" target="_blank">Hexagon</a>
            <img src="images/Nexus.jpg" alt="Nexus Hexagon">
            <p>Alignment can be hard to pull off with a design like Nexus from Hexagon, however, they do a great job of providing balance to the whole experience. Many objects are left aligned. Others are placed right to show contrast such as iamges. This gives hierarchy to the elements in the design.</p>
